- Advanced language model features

### 🟢 Working Without API Key
- Document processing and validation
- Text chunking and analysis
- Basic risk classification
- Legal term identification
- Service status monitoring
- File upload handling

## 📁 Test Files Created

1. **`test_phase1.py`** - Comprehensive Phase 1 test suite
2. **`test_api.py`** - API endpoint testing script
3. **`test_text_analysis.py`** - Direct service testing
4. **`test_legal_text.txt`** - Sample legal document for testing
5. **`create_test_pdf.py`** - PDF generation script (optional)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing (No API Key Required)
1. **Start the server**: `python main.py`
2. **Test API endpoints**: Use `test_api.py` or curl commands
3. **Test text analysis**: Use `test_text_analysis.py`
4. **Upload test documents**: Use the `/api/v1/upload` endpoint

### When OpenAI API Key is Available
1. Set environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
2. Test AI-powered summarization
3. Verify enhanced legal term analysis
4. Test confidence scoring system

### Phase 2 Preparation
- All Phase 1 infrastructure is ready
- Services are modular and extensible
- API endpoints are properly structured
- Ready for advanced AI features

## 📊 Success Metrics Met

- ✅ **Document Processing**: PDF ingestion and text extraction working
