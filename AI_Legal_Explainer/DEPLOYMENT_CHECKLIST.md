- [ ] RDS not publicly accessible
- [ ] S3 bucket access restricted
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (if SSL certificate configured)
- [ ] Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] IAM roles follow least privilege principle

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ECS Service Won't Start

- [ ] Ensure S3 bucket name is correct
- [ ] Verify CloudFront distribution (if enabled)

### High Response Times
- [ ] Check CloudWatch metrics for bottlenecks
- [ ] Verify auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Check Redis connection and performance

## üìä Cost Optimization

### 11. Resource Optimization
- [ ] Use appropriate instance sizes (start with t3.micro)
- [ ] Enable auto-scaling based on demand
- [ ] Set up billing alerts
- [ ] Monitor unused resources
- [ ] Use Spot instances for non-critical workloads (if applicable)

### 12. Storage Optimization
- [ ] S3 lifecycle policies configured
- [ ] RDS storage autoscaling enabled
- [ ] CloudWatch log retention set appropriately
- [ ] Backup retention periods optimized

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### 13. Update Process
- [ ] Code changes committed to repository
- [ ] New Docker image built and tested
- [ ] Image pushed to ECR
- [ ] ECS service updated with new image
- [ ] Deployment monitored for success
- [ ] Rollback plan ready if needed

### 14. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms configured
- [ ] SNS notifications set up
- [ ] Performance baselines established
- [ ] Error tracking implemented
- [ ] User experience monitoring enabled

## üìö Useful Commands

### Infrastructure Management
```bash
# View infrastructure status
terraform show

# Plan changes
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

# Destroy infrastructure (be careful!)
terraform destroy -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```

### ECS Management
```bash
# View service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster ai-legal-cluster --services ai-legal-service

# View task logs
aws logs tail /ecs/ai-legal-explainer --follow

# Scale service
aws ecs update-service --cluster ai-legal-cluster --service ai-legal-service --desired-count 3
```

### Docker Management
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t ai-legal-explainer:latest .

# Test locally
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-legal-explainer:latest
